Storage definition language (SDL): is used to specify the internal schema.
In most relational DBMSs today, there is no specific language that
performs the role of SDL. Instead, the internal schema is specified by a combination
of functions, parameters, and specifications related to storage


data definition language (DDL): conceptual and internal schemas

the view definition language (VDL), to specify user views and their mappings to the
conceptual schema, but in most DBMSs the DDL is used to define both conceptual
and external schemas.
